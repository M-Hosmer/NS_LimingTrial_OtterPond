# Characterizing soil microbial communities in acidified forests in Nova Scotia using amplicon sequencing
Our study used amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA and ITS2 genes for bacterial/archaeal and fungal identification to characterize the soil microbial communities in a chronically acidified forest in Nova Scotia treated or untreated with crushed limestone. 
QIIME2 was used for processing raw sequencing files, the resulting exports are stored in QIIME2_exports. 
An R-markdown file with all the code used to analyze the sequencing data including running statistical and differential tests is included here. Folders with the statistical and differential abundance test results are also included.
